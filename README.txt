ML Agro Foot SARL - Static website template
Files included:
- index.html
- products.html
- about.html
- blog.html
- contact.html
- styles.css
- script.js
- images/ (placeholder folder, add your product photos here)

How to use:
1. Unzip the archive and open index.html in a browser to preview.
2. Replace files in the 'images' folder with your real product photos (keep same filenames or update paths).
3. Connect contact form to a backend (PHP, Node, formspree, etc.) for actual form submissions.
4. Deploy to any static hosting (Netlify, Vercel) or to your hosting provider/WAMP for local testing.

Notes:
- All images are placeholders; add high-resolution photos for a professional look.
- Colors and text are editable in styles.css.
- If you want a CMS (WordPress) or dynamic site (PHP + MySQL), tell me and I will provide that version.
